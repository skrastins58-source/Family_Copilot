# CI/CD Workflow Documentation

This README describes the CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) workflow used in this repository. The workflow is implemented using **GitHub Actions** and is designed to automate testing, building, and deployment processes with every code change.

## Overview

CI/CD automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. This ensures fast feedback, reliable releases, and improved code quality.

## Workflow Structure

The workflow typically includes the following stages:
- **Checkout:** Retrieve the latest code from the repository.
- **Install Dependencies:** Set up the environment with required packages.
- **Run Tests:** Execute automated tests to verify code changes.
- **Build:** Compile or package the application.
- **Deploy:** Deploy the application to the target environment (optional).
- **Notifications:** Inform developers of the build status (optional).

## Key Features

- Automated builds and tests on every push and pull request.
- Supports multiple environments (e.g., staging, production).
- Easy to extend and customize.
- Integrates with third-party deployment providers.
- Optional notifications via email, Slack, etc.

## How It Works

1. **Code Push/PR:** Developer pushes code or opens a pull request.
2. **Action Trigger:** GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
3. **CI Runs:** Workflow runs steps for installing dependencies, testing, building, and deploying.
4. **Feedback:** Results are reported on the PR or commit.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create `.github/workflows/` directory** (if it doesnâ€™t exist).
2. **Add a workflow YAML file.** Example: `ci-cd.yml`
3. **Customize the workflow** to fit your project needs.
4. **Commit and Push** the workflow file to your repository.

## Example Workflow YAML

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Example deployment step (customize as needed)
      # - name: Deploy
      #   run: echo "Deploy to hosting provider"
```

## Customization

- Modify steps to fit your language (Python, Java, etc.).
- Add deployment steps using your preferred provider.
- Integrate third-party actions for notifications or additional checks.

## Troubleshooting

- **Workflow not running?** Check triggers (`on:` section) and file location.
- **Step failures?** Read error logs under "Actions" tab for details.
- **Secrets or credentials?** Store them using GitHub Secrets.
