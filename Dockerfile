The GitHub Actions job fails because the workflow tries to build a Docker image, but there is no Dockerfile found in the repository root. To resolve this, add a Dockerfile to the repository root with a minimal configuration suitable for the project, or update the workflow to point to the correct Dockerfile location if it exists elsewhere. Example minimal Dockerfile for a Python app:

FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "your_main_script.py"]

Replace the requirements and script as appropriate for the project. Ensure the workflow file references the correct Dockerfile path.
